## unity-fmod-playground

A couple of scripts for implementing FMOD in Unity. Nothing fancy or optimal, just testing and experimenting.

*Example from NicoSpecialAmbianceTrigger.cs*  

An example of functionality. On trigger, generates a GameObject with the assigned event which moves with the player in the X-axis.  
Useful for large areas where you want 3D-events playing but not resort to copy/pasting emitters which can impact performance.   
  
### TODO:
* Create handles/gizmos for the start- and end positions.
* Comment the damn code...
